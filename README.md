## BTD6 AI 
Author: Chris Wong
Date: 6/23/24

Purpose:
This project is aimed to teach me how to utilize machine learning with some image processing aspects thrown in.

Program Goal:
Have an AI model beat a map in BTD6 by using machine learning.

Design:
The program will use image processing AI to gather the necessary information on screen. Using that information, the program will then decide where and when to place monkeys and over time learn how to beat a map in BTD6. It will choose where to place monkeys by first randomly generating positions, then over time it will see what works and what doesnâ€™t work.
